How much is cPanel for cloud servers?

cPanel costs $11.77/month or roughly $0.016/hour on our cloud servers.

=======================================================
How long does it take for a cloud server to be created?
=======================================================

Most cloud servers are provisioned in less than 5 minutes.
Microsoft Windows servers may take up to 10 minutes, however,
we are working to make this faster.

====================================
How is the data stored in the cloud?
====================================

The storage for the cloud is made up of a distributed SAN.
All of the SSD drives in the hypervisors are part of a striped and mirrored
RAID over a special storage network. Your instance is primarily stored
on the hypervisor that is serving it for quick access,
making our setup both Local and SAN.

====================================================
How fast is the network connection on cloud servers?
====================================================

Cloud servers are capable of up to 1Gbps.
While we make gigabit standard for cloud servers,
most of our competitors limit their instances to 100Mbps or less.

============================================
How does the billing work for cloud servers?
============================================

When purchasing a cloud server you are given the opportunity of choosing
between hourly or monthly billing. If you choose hourly, a minimum deposit
of $5 is required it your cloud server(s) will deduct from that amount hourly.

======================================
How do backups work for cloud servers?
======================================
At this time, you can use our Shared NAS to store backups that you make
through your operating system. In the future,
we will add an easy snapshot feature.

===============================================
Does LSN Cloud support nested KVM environments?
===============================================

No, nested KVM virtualization is considered unstable.
As the technology advances, we will certainly look into it in the future.

You can, however, order Citrix XenServer in our cloud.

====================================
How can I proactively stop Phishing?
====================================

Internally, Limestone Networks has been using the help of `PhishTank <https://www.phishtank.com/>`_

Recently we made this feature available directly to our clients within our
control panel. You can access it by clicking on the Servers tab and then
clicking phishing sites.

======================================
Do you offer Windows on cloud servers?
======================================

Yes, there are various Microsoft Windows options on our order form for
the cloud. The provisioning time is slightly longer (under 10 minutes)
due to the way the filesystem works for Windows.

Additionally, we offer Windows desktop environments like Windows 7 and
Windows 8 so that you may create a cloud server to run as a virtual desktop.

our provisioning time may be longer. We appreciate your patience

plans you can choose from depending on the level of management you need.
