====================================
 you offer Windows on cloud servers?
====================================

Yes, there are various Microsoft Windows options on our order form for
the cloud. The provisioning time is slightly longer (under 10 minutes)
due to the way the filesystem works for Windows.

Additionally, we offer Windows desktop environments like Windows 7 and
Windows 8 so that you may create a cloud server to run as a virtual desktop.
