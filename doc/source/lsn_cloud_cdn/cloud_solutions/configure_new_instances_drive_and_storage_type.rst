How to configure a new Cloud instance’s drive type and storage.
===============================================================

If you’re looking to create a VM with a custom storage size and type,
you’ll want to create a new Volume.

Once you’ve created the volume you can use it to launch a new VM.

When launching your new instance make sure you select ``Boot from volume``
in the ``Instance Boot Source`` drop down box.

This will open up a new drop down box which will allow you to choose which
``Volume`` you would like to have the VM boot from.
