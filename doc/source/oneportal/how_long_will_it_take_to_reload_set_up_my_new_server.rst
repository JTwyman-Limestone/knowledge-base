How long will it take to reload / set up my new server?
=======================================================

Limestone is known for its extremely quick provisioning times.

Our normal provisioning time is 1-4 hours, however, in some cases,
our provisioning time may be longer. We appreciate your patience
and we will have your server online as soon as possible.

Please note: Custom partitioning will require extra time to
provision your server (up to 24 hours).

Our current record for the fastest provision is 16 minutes.
This includes formatting, operating system installation,
and configuration.
