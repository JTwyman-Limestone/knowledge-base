How do I configure the Windows Firewall?
========================================

Microsoft has developed a great article centered around configuration
of the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security and IPsec Policies.

This step-by-step guide illustrates how to deploy Active DirectoryÂ® Group
Policy objects (GPOs) to configure Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
in Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008.
Although you can configure a single server locally by using Group Policy
Management tools directly on the server, that method is not consistent or
efficient when you have many computers to configure.
When you have multiple computers to manage, create and edit GPOs,
and then apply those GPOs to the computers in your organization.
Common scenarios, including firewall rule deployment, server and domain
isolation, and IPsec tunnel mode configuration are discussed.
