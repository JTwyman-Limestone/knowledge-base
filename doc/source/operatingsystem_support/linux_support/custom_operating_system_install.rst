==================================================
Do you support my Custom Operating System install?
==================================================

Only operating systems listed on the Limestone order form and installed
by Limestone technicians are supported by our technical staff.
We will make a best effort attempt to support OS installs not meeting this
criteria if time permits, however in most cases customers with custom OS
installs or “Install Your Own OS” systems will be required to maintain their
own OS by means of IPMI (on applicable servers) or a KVMoIP unit which
we lease on an hourly basis.

This is not applicable to network or hardware issues, and those items will
be maintained per our normal support procedures by technical staff
regardless of OS install method.

The rates for KVMoIP are as follows:

- $5/hour (minimum of 3 hours)
- $30/day (for a 24 hour period)
- $60/month
