How can I proactively stop Phishing?
====================================

Internally, Limestone Networks has been using the help of `PhishTank <https://www.phishtank.com/>`_
to report phishing websites to our clients.
Recently we made this feature available directly to our clients within our
control panel. You can access it by clicking on the Servers tab and then
clicking phishing sites.
