IPv6 rDNS
=========

Limestone uses delegation when it comes to IPv6.

Currently, One Portal does not support adding IPv6 rDNS entries.

If you would like to have rDNS configured on your IPv6 addresses youâ€™ll
need to open up a Support ticket with the nameservers you would like the
DNS delegated to.
