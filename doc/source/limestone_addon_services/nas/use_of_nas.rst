What can I use the NAS for?
===========================

NAS (Network Attached Storage) can be used to store files for:

- Incremental Backups
- Additional Storage
- Transfer / sync files between servers

Limestone’s NAS systems are on Limestone’s Private Tunnel which means you get unmetered free transfer between your NAS space and your servers.
