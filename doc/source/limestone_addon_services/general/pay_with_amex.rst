====================================
How can I pay with American Express?
====================================

Limestone Networks does not directly accept American Express,
however you may still choose to use American Express through PayPal.
A PayPal account is not required in order to use this method.

Here is how to set up your PayPal billing source:

1. Login to our control panel and go to the `Billing Sources <https://rw.limestonenetworks.com/billing/sources.html>`_ page.
2. Click the “Add a Source” link.
3. For “Payment Type”, choose “PayPal”.
4. If you have a PayPal account, put that email address into the
   “PayPal Email” field. If you do not have a PayPal account,
   put your standard email address.
5. Press “Add Source”.

Now you have the billing source set up.
You can choose it as a payment option when either paying an invoice
or prepaying your account.

After being transferred to PayPal, if you do not have a PayPal account
you may enter your credit card information in the form provided.
You may have to select “I don’t have a PayPal Account” in order for
the form to show.

If you have any further questions, please let us know.
