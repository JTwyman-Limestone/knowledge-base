Can I run my own Minecraft Server at Limestone?
===============================================

You sure can! Minecraft has a beta `dedicated server <https://www.limestonenetworks.com/dedicated-servers/bare-metal.html>`_
available on `their site <https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/>`_
which you can use to run your own Minecraft server.

Simply check out our `Game Hosting <https://www.limestonenetworks.com/solutions/game-servers.html>`_
solutions to get started. We would recommend no less than a
4 (quad) core server for this. Additionally, the more RAM you put in the
server will determine how large your Minecraft environment can be.
